#            ARBITARY ARGUMENTS
# Every customer buys a different number of items.
#
# Customer 1 buys 2 items.
# Customer 2 buys 5 items.
# Customer 3 buys 10 items.
#
# You don't know in advance how many item prices will be passed.

# Design a Python program for a supermarket billing system. Create a function calculate_total(*prices)
# that accepts the prices of multiple items and returns their total cost. Then define a function
# apply_discount(*amount) that applies a 10% discount if the total exceeds 1500. Finally, create a function
# final_bill(**details) that accepts keyword arguments such as amount, tax, and packing_charge, and
# returns the final payable bill. Display the final amount using a single nested function call.
